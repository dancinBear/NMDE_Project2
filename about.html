		<h2> About Rosie </h2>
		<p>Rosalie Cooper was one of the coolest people I have ever had the pleasure of knowing. For most of the sliver of her life that I knew her, she was known for talking with strangers as if they were friends, and swimming nearly every day. She would make hats and scarves for me and my cousins every year around the holidays, and whenever we visited her in Florida she would make the most incredible food. I will never be able to truly capture the magic that she baked into everything she made, but I can at least try to share it.</p>
		<p>May she walk her hundredth year among the stars.</p>
